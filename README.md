This practice Blazor app consists of a Blazor Server app that simulates a portal for employees to manage business details of a hotel,
a Blazor webassembly app that simulates a website for customers to reserve a hotel room, 
and an API that communicates database data and transactions to the Webassembly app.

Concepts that I have learned and implemented into this API are:

- Blazor Server and Webassembly
- ASP.NET Core Web API
- Entity Framework Core
- Repository pattern
- ASP.NET Identity
- DTO models and mapping objects with Automapper
- Javascript Runtime Calls
- Parent and Child Components
- Component Parameters and Event Callbacks
- Uploading and Displaying User Image Files
- Local Storage
- JWT tokens
- Authentication State
- HTTP Client
- Processing user payments using Stripe
